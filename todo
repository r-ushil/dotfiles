fix screen sharing

	looks like i need to set XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=sway

	need to import-env to systemctl with above and XDG_SESSION_TYPE

	need to update the dbus activation env with WAYLAND_DISPLAY

	xdg-desktop-portal-wlr is inactive (systemctl status) - find out why



fix the alt-shift-e (lock menu) - swaynag is fucking ugly
